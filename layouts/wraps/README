Wraps are used in conjunction with other layouts in order to render HTML before and after layout output.

Traditionally, wraps have been used in the presentation of Modules, but in Molajo, a wrap
can be specified for use with any extension layout to achieve different types of rendered output objectives.

Within the Template, use the 'wrap' attribute in the jdoc statement, as shown below, to wrap the layout output
using the wrap layout specified as the attribute.

<jdoc:include type="modules" name="user1" wrap="rounded" />

<jdoc:include type="component" wrap="div" />

Backwards compatability:
 chrome => will be treated as 'wrap'.

Attributes:
 Horz => treated as 'horizontal'.
 xhtml => treated as 'div'.
 rounded => treated as 'div'.
