Chrome is used in conjunction with extension layouts to render HTML before and after
layout output so that it can be styled using CSS.

Traditionally, chrome has been used in the presentation of Modules to add styling effects,
like rounded corners, but in Molajo, chrome can be specified for use with any extension layout
to achieve different types of rendered output objectives.

Within the Template, Module chrome is specified using the 'style' attribute
in the jdoc statement, as pictured below:

<jdoc:include type="modules" name="user1" style="rounded" />

<jdoc:include type="component" style="xhtml" />
