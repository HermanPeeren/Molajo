Wraps are used in conjunction with other layouts in order to render HTML before and after layout output.

Traditionally, wraps have been used in the presentation of Modules, but in Molajo, a wrap
can be specified for use with any extension layout to achieve different types of rendered output objectives.

Within the Template, use the 'wrap' attribute in the jdoc statement, as shown below, to wrap the layout output
using the wrap layout specified as the attribute.

<jdoc:include type="modules" name="user1" wrap="rounded" />

<jdoc:include type="component" wrap="div" />

Backwards compatability:
 chrome => will be treated as 'wrap'.

Attributes:
 Horz => treated as 'horizontal'.
 xhtml => treated as 'div'.
 rounded => treated as 'div'.
 
CSS and JS:
 CSS and JS files, located within CSS and JS directories in your wrap directory, will be loaded when that layout is used
 CSS files beginning with rtl_ will be loaded when the language is an rtl language 

6 possible files within the layouts folder of a wrap:
 top.php runs one time => before the set of rows are processed
 bottom.php runs one time => after the set of rows are processed 
 header.php, body.php, and then footer.php will be run for or each row returned, even if it's just one row
 - you don't have to worry about the loop - molajo will do it for you
 - you don't HAVE to have each of these files => but if they exist, that's how they are used
 
 custom.php: if that file exists in the layouts folder => then molajo sends the entire $rowset object => and you have to handle the loop yourself
