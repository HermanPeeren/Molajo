Sample Template

1. template.xml

Used by the installer to define metadata, files and folders and parameters for the template.

2. index.php

Initial file retrieved and executed by Molajo during the rendering process.

<jdoc:include type="head" />

<jdoc:include type="page" />

3. css folder

4. js folder

5. language folder

6. page folder

Tbe <jdoc:include type="page" /> is located in the index.php file and it identifies
the location to render the configured template page output.

The template page parameter can be defined in several places in Molajo.

The value Molajo elects to use is the first found, given this search order:

- URL Request Parameter: page=value
- Content Item Configuration
- Menu Item Configuration (only for Component Menu Item Type)
- Primary or secondary Category Configuration
- Component Configuration
- Application Configuration (which defaults to default or the only option available in the page subfolder)

Within the page folder is a folder for each page option available to the application.

The following are special purpose pages and should be available in each template:

- default
- error
- logon (for applications that first require logon, like the administrator)
- offline
- print

6a. error

6b. logon

6c. offline

6d. print

6e. default (or any other page value)

The page subfolder can have the following files and folders (and others, as needed).

- css - Molajo will automatically load the css files contained within this subfolder if the page is used.
- js - same as css
- images - to store images, if necessary
index.php - should contain html and jdoc statements defining layout
